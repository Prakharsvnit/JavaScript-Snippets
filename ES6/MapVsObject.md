### Difference between Map and object:

|      Map     |     Object    |
|:------------:|:------------:|
| Maps can contain objects and other data types as keys. | Objects can only contain strings and symbols as keys. |
| Maps can be directly iterated and their value can be accessed. | Objects can be iterated by accessing its keys. |
| The number of elements of a Map can be determined by size property. | The number of elements of an object needs to be determined manually. |
| Map performs better for programs that require the addition or removal of elements frequently. | Object does not perform well if the program requires the addition or removal of elements frequently. |
